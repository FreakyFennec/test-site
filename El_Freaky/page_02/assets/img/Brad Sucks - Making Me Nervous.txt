Brad Sucks - Making Me Nervous

Here we go
One step at a time don't be living on the line
I don't need a friend i got morbid on the mind
Sunshine in my brain making everyone complain
Radio in the heart don't be being so strange

I think i'm losing it baby where you been
Everybody says that you're moving again
I don't wanna be right baby every single night
I could tell you a thing about taking your time
It's making me nervous yeah
